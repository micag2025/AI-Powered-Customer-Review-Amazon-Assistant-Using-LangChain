home_improvement,"I do love these chair socks. They match the color of our dining chairs. But they don’t always stay put. I’ve found if you have a chair (or two) that is used more frequently, being pulled in and out from under the table, they weaken the material and slide off the leg. I still continue to use the socks because they are keeping my hardwood floors from scratching but I wish they would have a bit more elastic in them to stay put on the legs.",Neutral,"**Support:** Thank you for sharing your feedback on the chair socks.

industrial_supplies,"Had some problems getting it to work. The supplied cable was no good - would not charge the battery.
