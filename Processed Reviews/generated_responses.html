      <td>I do love these chair socks. They match the color of our dining chairs. But they don’t always stay put. I’ve found if you have a chair (or two) that is used more frequently, being pulled in and out from under the table, they weaken the material and slide off the leg. I still continue to use the socks because they are keeping my hardwood floors from scratching but I wish they would have a bit more elastic in them to stay put on the legs.</td>

PC program works well for testing the unit after you figure out which port to use (port 4 in my case).
